          <h1>STUDIØ 27: A NEW CREATIVE STUDIO REDEFINING CULINARY CREATIVITY AND EXPERIENTIAL DESIGN</h1>
            <p>STUDIØ 27 is a creative studio that is reshaping the boundaries of gastronomy,fashion, design and contemporary art. Founded by Brussels-based chef Paul-Antoine - Polo - Bertin, STUDIØ 27 seamlessly merges these diverse disciplines to craft extraordinary experiences, immersive installations and meaningful connections. With a changing team of talented designers, architects, florists and technical experts, STUDIØ 27 has collaborated with renowned brands such as Massimo Dutti (wtih “Profirst”), Repetto, Coperni, Evian and Renaissance Shop, and Courrèges (after show with “Le Fooding”), as well as with private clients.<br> <br>
              STUDIØ 27 was born out of the increasing demand for Polo Bertin and Nathan Gullentops' culinary expertise, which initially surfaced during their work at Ötap. As requests for floral arrangements, event setups, and creative ideas multiplied, they recognised the potential to create something truly exceptional. To meet this demand, they assembled a team of skilled professionals, including designers, architects, and scenographers, to tailor each event to the client's unique vision. <br><br>
              Inspiration at STUDIØ 27 stems from the worlds of fashion, design, everyday life and the talents of friends and architects. Their vision is to curate customised events that seamlessly align with the desires of brands and clients, ensuring an unforgettable experience for all participants.
